- nudging users toward better security habits, using passwords as example
- Background, Context:
  - normal folks ("non-technical people") have bad security habits
    - not lazy or stupid, rather different priorities
      - no social pressures in private life re: password hygiene
      - not on high alert if haven't experienced identity theft, password takeover
  - examples of bad password hygiene (larger population and Mark Zuckerberg)
  - gonna assume/skip over the technical bits of security which should just be in place: HTTPs everwhere, hash and salt passwords, eliminate XSS opportunities, multiple account management, etc.
  - behavior design: guiding users toward desired (more secure) actions
    - combo of limiting options, incentivizing desired behaviors
    - irritating the user until they do what you want
    - ~ manipulation, persuasion
    - examples (not necessarily security, just of behavior design more generally) with cognitive dissonance:
      - http://confirmshaming.tumblr.com/ (e.g. choice between desired yes-type response and "No, I like to make bad choices")
      - Amazon making you claim you're not you in order to sign out
- Security-Focused Behavior Design:
  - good copywriting
  - talk about benefits, rather than features
    - instead of the mechanism, talk about how it'll improve the user's life
    - appeal to unsatisfied needs
  - good security habits work by creating friction
    - so yes, that friction can also be friction for the user to sign-up/convert
    - A/B test!
    - consider the tradeoffs and evaluation your priorities
